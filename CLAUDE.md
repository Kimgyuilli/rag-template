# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot built with Spring Boot. The system ingests documents, chunks and embeds them into a vector store, then retrieves relevant context to answer user questions via LLM.

## Tech Stack

- Java 21, Spring Boot 4.0.1, Gradle 9.2.1 (wrapper included)
- PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector (vector similarity search)
- OpenAI API (embeddings + chat completion)
- JUnit 5 for testing

## Build & Run

```bash
./gradlew clean build          # Build
./gradlew build -x test        # Build without tests
./gradlew bootRun              # Run application
./gradlew test                 # Run all tests
./gradlew test --tests "com.example.rag.SomeTest"           # Single test class
./gradlew test --tests "com.example.rag.SomeTest.method"    # Single test method
```

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`.
PostgreSQL with pgvector runs via Docker Compose on port 5432 (database: `ragdb`).

## Coding Principles

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```
